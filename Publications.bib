	abstract = {Mechanisms by which specific histone modifications regulate distinct gene networks remain little understood. We investigated how H3K79me2, a modification catalyzed by DOT1L and previously considered a general transcriptional activation mark, regulates gene expression during cardiogenesis. Embryonic cardiomyocyte ablation of Dot1l revealed that H3K79me2 does not act as a general transcriptional activator, but rather regulates highly specific transcriptional networks at two critical cardiogenic junctures: embryonic cardiogenesis, where it was particularly important for left ventricle-specific genes, and postnatal cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal, with Dot1L mutants having more mononuclear cardiomyocytes and prolonged cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity. Mechanistic analyses revealed that H3K79me2 in two distinct domains, gene bodies and regulatory elements, synergized to promote expression of genes activated by DOT1L. Surprisingly, H3K79me2 in specific regulatory elements also contributed to silencing genes usually not expressed in cardiomyocytes. These results reveal mechanisms by which DOT1L successively regulates left ventricle specification and cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal.},

The lncRNA HIF1α-AS1 was retrieved as a top hit. Endogenous HIF1α-AS1 reduces the expression of numerous genes, including EPH Receptor A2 and Adrenomedullin through DNA:DNA:RNA triplex formation by acting as an adapter for the repressive human silencing hub complex (HUSH). Moreover, the oxygen-sensitive HIF1α-AS1 is down-regulated in pulmonary hypertension and loss-of-function approaches not only result in gene de-repression but also enhance angiogenic capacity.

This makes accurate computational prediction of such interactions highly important in the field of RNA research. Current predictive methods use canonical Hoogsteen base pairing rules, which whilst biophysically valid, may not reflect the plastic nature of cell biology. Here, we present the first optimization approach to learn a probabilistic model describing RNA-DNA interactions directly from motifs derived from triplex sequencing data. We find that there are several stable interaction codes, including Hoogsteen base pairing and novel RNA-DNA base pairings, which agree with in vitro measurements. We implemented these findings in TriplexAligner, a program that uses the determined interaction codes to predict triplex binding. TriplexAligner predicts RNA-DNA interactions identified in all-to-all sequencing data more accurately than all previously published tools in human and mouse and also predicts previously studied triplex interactions with known regulatory functions. We further validated a novel triplex interaction using biophysical experiments. Our work is an important step towards better understanding of triplex formation and allows genome-wide analyses of RNA-DNA interactions.},

Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate physiological and pathophysiological processes and are primary pharmacological targets. DNA binding of the important loop-forming insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) was modulated by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). We performed CTCF HiChIP assays to produce the first genome-wide dataset of CTCF long-range interactions in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells, and to determine whether dynamic changes of spatial chromatin interactions are essential for fine-tuning of nuclear receptor signaling. We detected changes in 3D chromatin organization upon vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation at 3.1\% of all observed CTCF interactions. VDR binding was enriched at both differential loop anchors and within differential loops. Differential loops were observed in several putative functional roles including TAD border formation, promoter-enhancer looping, and establishment of VDR-responsive insulated neighborhoods. Vitamin D target genes were enriched in differential loops and at their anchors. Secondary vitamin D effects related to dynamic chromatin domain changes were linked to location of downstream transcription factors in differential loops. CRISPR interference and loop anchor deletion experiments confirmed the functional relevance of nuclear receptor ligand-induced adjustments of the chromatin 3D structure for gene expression regulation.},

	abstract = {The unicellular ciliate Paramecium contains a large vegetative macronucleus with several unusual characteristics, including an extremely high coding density and high polyploidy. As macronculear chromatin is devoid of heterochromatin, our study characterizes the functional epigenomic organization necessary for gene regulation and proper Pol II activity. Histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27me3) reveal no narrow peaks but broad domains along gene bodies, whereas intergenic regions are devoid of nucleosomes. Our data implicate H3K4me3 levels inside ORFs to be the main factor associated with gene expression, and H3K27me3 appears in association with H3K4me3 in plastic genes. Silent and lowly expressed genes show low nucleosome occupancy, suggesting that gene inactivation does not involve increased nucleosome occupancy and chromatin condensation. Because of a high occupancy of Pol II along highly expressed ORFs, transcriptional elongation appears to be quite different from that of other species. This is supported by missing heptameric repeats in the C-terminal domain of Pol II and a divergent elongation system. Our data imply that unoccupied DNA is the default state, whereas gene activation requires nucleosome recruitment together with broad domains of H3K4me3. In summary, gene activation and silencing in Paramecium run counter to the current understanding of chromatin biology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the rise of single-cell RNA sequencing new bioinformatic tools have been developed to handle specific demands, such as quantifying unique molecular identifiers and correcting cell barcodes. Here, we benchmarked several datasets with the most common alignment tools for single-cell RNA sequencing data. We evaluated differences in the whitelisting, gene quantification, overall performance, and potential variations in clustering or detection of differentially expressed genes. We compared the tools Cell Ranger version 6, STARsolo, Kallisto, Alevin, and Alevin-fry on 3 published datasets for human and mouse, sequenced with different versions of the 10X sequencing protocol.
RESULTS: Striking differences were observed in the overall runtime of the mappers. Besides that, Kallisto and Alevin showed variances in the number of valid cells and detected genes per cell. Kallisto reported the highest number of cells; however, we observed an overrepresentation of cells with low gene content and unknown cell type. Conversely, Alevin rarely reported such low-content cells. Further variations were detected in the set of expressed genes. While STARsolo, Cell Ranger 6, Alevin-fry, and Alevin produced similar gene sets, Kallisto detected additional genes from the Vmn and Olfr gene family, which are likely mapping artefacts. We also observed differences in the mitochondrial content of the resulting cells when comparing a prefiltered annotation set to the full annotation set that includes pseudogenes and other biotypes.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this study provides a detailed comparison of common single-cell RNA sequencing mappers and shows their specific properties on 10X Genomics data.},

Here, we follow the question why the mechanism of transgene-induced silencing in the ciliate Paramecium needs both Dicer activity and two Ptiwi proteins. This pathway involves primary siRNAs produced from non-translatable transgenes and secondary siRNAs from targeted endogenous loci. Our data does not indicate any signatures from ping-pong amplification but Dicer cleavage of long dsRNA. Ptiwi13 and 14 prefer different sub-cellular localizations and different preferences for primary and secondary siRNAs but do not load them mutually exclusive. Both Piwis enrich for antisense RNAs and show a general preference for uridine-rich sRNAs along the entire sRNA length. In addition, Ptiwi14-loaded siRNAs show a 5´-U signature. Our data indicates both Ptiwis and 2´-O-methylation contributing to strand selection of Dicer cleaved siRNAs. This unexpected function of the two distinct vegetative Piwis extends the increasing knowledge of the diversity of Piwi functions in diverse silencing pathways. We describe an unusual mode of action of Piwi proteins extending not only the great variety of Piwi-associated RNAi pathways but moreover raising the question whether this could have been the primordial one.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Based on reports on elevated cholesterol levels in cancer cells, strategies to lower cholesterol synthesis have been suggested as an antitumour strategy. However, cholesterol depletion has also been shown to induce tumour-promoting actions in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs).
METHODS: We performed lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses of human lung cancer material. To assess whether the TAM phenotype is shaped by secreted factors produced by tumour cells, primary human monocyte-derived macrophages were polarized towards a TAM-like phenotype using tumour cell-conditioned medium.
FINDINGS: Lipidomic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (n=29) and adjacent non-tumour tissues (n=22) revealed a significant accumulation of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters within the tumour tissue. In contrast, cholesterol levels were reduced in TAMs isolated from lung adenocarcinoma tissues when compared with alveolar macrophages (AMs) obtained from adjacent non-tumour tissues. Bulk-RNA-Seq revealed that genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism were downregulated in TAMs, while cholesterol efflux transporters were upregulated. In vitro polarized TAM-like macrophages showed an attenuated lipogenic gene expression signature and exhibited lower cholesterol levels compared with non-polarized macrophages. A genome-wide comparison by bulk RNA-Seq confirmed a high similarity of ex vivo TAMs and in vitro TAM-like macrophages. Modulation of intracellular cholesterol levels by either starving, cholesterol depletion, or efflux transporter inhibition indicated that cholesterol distinctly shapes macrophage gene expression.
INTERPRETATION: Our data show an opposite dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in tumour tissue vs. TAMs. Polarization of in vitro differentiated macrophages by tumour cell-conditioned medium recapitulates key features of ex vivo TAMs.

Regulatory regions can be associated to genes using large-scale datasets of epigenetic and expression data.

We present StitchIt, an approach to dissect epigenetic variation in a gene-specific manner for the detection of regulatory elements (REMs) without relying on peak calls in individual samples. StitchIt segments epigenetic signal tracks over many samples to generate the location and the target genes of a REM simultaneously. We show that this approach leads to a more accurate and refined REM detection compared to standard methods even on heterogeneous datasets, which are challenging to model. Also, StitchIt REMs are highly enriched in experimentally determined chromatin interactions and expression quantitative trait loci. We validated several newly predicted REMs using CRISPR-Cas9 experiments, thereby demonstrating the reliability of StitchIt. StitchIt is able to dissect regulation in superenhancers and predicts thousands of putative REMs that go unnoticed using peak-based approaches suggesting that a large part of the regulome might be uncharted water.},

As it was shown that gene regulation by TFs differs depending on the CpG class of a promoter, we study the impact of the CpG content in promoters on the associations between TFs and HMs. We suggest an approach based on sparse linear regression models to infer associations between TFs and HMs with respect to CpG content. A study of the partial correlation of HMs for the two classes of high and low CpG content reveals possible CpG dependence and potential candidates for confounding factors in our models. We show that the models are accurate, inferred associations reflect known biological relationships, and we give new insight into associations with respect to CpG content. Moreover, analysis of a ChIP-seq dataset in HepG2 cells of the HM H3K122ac, an HM about little is known, reveals novel TF associations and supports a previously established link to active transcription.},

	abstract = {The transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR) is the high affinity nuclear target of the biologically active form of vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). In order to identify pure genomic transcriptional effects of 1,25(OH)2D3, we used VDR cistrome, transcriptome and open chromatin data, obtained from the human monocytic cell line THP-1, for a novel hierarchical analysis applying three bioinformatics approaches. We predicted 75.6\% of all early 1,25(OH)2D3-responding (2.5 or 4 h) and 57.4\% of the late differentially expressed genes (24 h) to be primary VDR target genes. VDR knockout led to a complete loss of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced genome-wide gene regulation. Thus, there was no indication of any VDR-independent non-genomic actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 modulating its transcriptional response. Among the predicted primary VDR target genes, 47 were coding for transcription factors and thus may mediate secondary 1,25(OH)2D3 responses. CEBPA and ETS1 ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq following CEBPA knockdown were used to validate the predicted regulation of secondary vitamin D target genes by both transcription factors. In conclusion, a directional network containing 47 partly novel primary VDR target transcription factors describes secondary responses in a highly complex vitamin D signaling cascade. The central transcription factor VDR is indispensable for all transcriptome-wide effects of the nuclear hormone.},

Tissue ischemia induced by infarction leads to profound changes in endothelial cell functions and can induce transition to a mesenchymal state. Here we explore the kinetics and individual cellular responses of endothelial cells after myocardial infarction by using single cell RNA sequencing. This study demonstrates a time dependent switch in endothelial cell proliferation and inflammation associated with transient changes in metabolic gene signatures. Trajectory analysis reveals that the majority of endothelial cells 3 to 7 days after myocardial infarction acquire a transient state, characterized by mesenchymal gene expression, which returns to baseline 14 days after injury. Lineage tracing, using the Cdh5-CreERT2;mT/mG mice followed by single cell RNA sequencing, confirms the transient mesenchymal transition and reveals additional hypoxic and inflammatory signatures of endothelial cells during early and late states after injury. These data suggest that endothelial cells undergo a transient mes-enchymal activation concomitant with a metabolic adaptation within the first days after myocardial infarction but do not acquire a long-term mesenchymal fate. This mesenchymal activation may facilitate endothelial cell migration and clonal expansion to regenerate the vascular network.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The generation of genome-wide maps of histone modifications using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing is a standard approach to dissect the complexity of the epigenome. Interpretation and differential analysis of histone datasets remains challenging due to regulatory meaningful co-occurrences of histone marks and their difference in genomic spread. To ease interpretation, chromatin state segmentation maps are a commonly employed abstraction combining individual histone marks. We developed the tool SCIDDO as a fast, flexible and statistically sound method for the differential analysis of chromatin state segmentation maps.
RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of SCIDDO in a comparative analysis that identifies differential chromatin domains (DCD) in various regulatory contexts and with only moderate computational resources. We show that the identified DCDs correlate well with observed changes in gene expression and can recover a substantial number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We showcase SCIDDO's ability to directly interrogate chromatin dynamics, such as enhancer switches in downstream analysis, which simplifies exploring specific questions about regulatory changes in chromatin. By comparing SCIDDO to competing methods, we provide evidence that SCIDDO's performance in identifying DEGs via differential chromatin marking is more stable across a range of cell-type comparisons and parameter cut-offs.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful technology to discover new cell types and study biological processes in complex biological samples. A current challenge is to predict transcription factor (TF) regulation from single-cell RNA data.
RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel approach for predicting gene expression at the single-cell level using cis-regulatory motifs, as well as epigenetic features. We designed a tree-guided multi-task learning framework that considers each cell as a task. Through this framework we were able to explain the single-cell gene expression values using either TF binding affinities or TF ChIP-seq data measured at specific genomic regions. TFs identified using these models could be validated by the literature.
CONCLUSION: Our proposed method allows us to identify distinct TFs that show cell type-specific regulation. This approach is not limited to TFs but can use any type of data that can potentially be used in explaining gene expression at the single-cell level to study factors that drive differentiation or show abnormal regulation in disease.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. NADPH oxidases of the Nox family produce ROS but their contribution to atherosclerosis development is less clear. Nox2 promotes and Nox4 rather limits atherosclerosis. Although Nox1 with its cytosolic co-factors are largely expressed in epithelial cells, a role for Nox1 for atherosclerosis development was suggested. To further define the role of this homologue, the role of its essential cytosolic cofactor, NoxO1, was determined for atherosclerosis development with the aid of knockout mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Wildtype (WT) and NoxO1 knockout mice were treated with high fat diet and adeno-associated virus (AAV) overexpressing pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) to induce hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor loss. As a result, massive hypercholesterolemia was induced and spontaneous atherosclerosis developed within three month. Deletion of NoxO1 reduced atherosclerosis formation in brachiocephalic artery and aortic arch in female but not male NoxO1-/- mice as compared to WT littermates. This was associated with a reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine signature in the plasma of female but not male NoxO1-/- mice. MACE-RNAseq of the vessel did not reveal this signature and the expression of the Nox1/NoxO1 system was low to not detectable.
CONCLUSIONS: The scaffolding protein NoxO1 plays some role in atherosclerosis development in female mice probably by attenuating the global inflammatory burden.},

It has been suggested that macrophage activation plays a key role in the induction and maintenance of this state. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for aging-associated changes in the myeloid compartment of mice. The aging phenotype, characterized by elevated cytokine production, was associated with a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and diminished serum corticosteroid levels. In particular, the concentration of corticosterone, the major active glucocorticoid in rodents, was decreased. This could be explained by an impaired expression and activity of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), an enzyme that determines the extent of cellular glucocorticoid responses by reducing the corticosteroids cortisone/11-dehydrocorticosterone to their active forms cortisol/corticosterone, in aged macrophages and peripheral leukocytes. These changes were accompanied by a downregulation of the glucocorticoid receptor target gene glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) in vitro and in vivo. Since GILZ plays a central role in macrophage activation, we hypothesized that the loss of GILZ contributed to the process of macroph-aging. The phenotype of macrophages from aged mice was indeed mimicked in young GILZ knockout mice. In summary, the current study provides insight into the role of glucocorticoid metabolism and GILZ regulation during aging.},

The biotechnical potential of feeding techniques is evident from the numerous studies focusing on oral administration of dsRNA to control pests and viral infection in crops/animal farming. We aimed to dissect the direct and indirect effects of exo-dsRNA feeding on the endogenous short interfering RNA (endo-siRNA) populations of the free-living ciliate Paramecium. We introduced dsRNA fragments against Dicer1 (DCR1), involved in RNA interference (RNAi) against exo- and few endo-siRNAs, and an RNAi unrelated gene, ND169. Any feeding, even the control dsRNA, diminishes genome wide the accumulation of endo-siRNAs and mRNAs. This cannot be explained by direct off-target effects and suggests mechanistic overlaps of the exo- and endo-RNAi mechanisms. Nevertheless, we observe a stronger down-regulation of mRNAs in DCR1 feeding compared with ND169 knockdown. This is likely due to the direct involvement of DCR1 in endo-siRNA accumulation. We further observed a cis-regulatory effect on mRNAs that overlap with phased endo-siRNAs. This interference of exo-dsRNA with endo-siRNAs warrants further investigations into secondary effects in target species/consumers, risk assessment of dsRNA feeding applications, and environmental pollution with dsRNA.},

Both protective and deleterious effects of endocannabinoids in the cardiovascular system have been reported but the mechanistic basis for these contradicting observations is unclear. We set out to identify anti-inflammatory mechanisms of endocannabinoids in the murine aorta and in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC). In response to combined stimulation with cytokines, IL-1β and TNFα, the murine aorta released several endocannabinoids, with anandamide (AEA) levels being the most significantly increased. AEA pretreatment had profound effects on cytokine-induced gene expression in hVSMC and murine aorta. As revealed by RNA-Seq analysis, the induction of a subset of 21 inflammatory target genes, including the important cytokine CCL2 was blocked by AEA. This effect was not mediated through AEA-dependent interference of the AP-1 or NF-κB pathways but rather through an epigenetic mechanism. In the presence of AEA, ATAC-Seq analysis and chromatin-immunoprecipitations revealed that CCL2 induction was blocked due to increased levels of H3K27me3 and a decrease of H3K27ac leading to compacted chromatin structure in the CCL2 promoter. These effects were mediated by recruitment of HDAC4 and the nuclear corepressor NCoR1 to the CCL2 promoter. This study therefore establishes a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism for the endogenous endocannabinoid AEA in vascular smooth muscle cells.

However, elevated SRSF7 levels inhibit NMD and promote translation of two protein halves, termed Split-ORFs, from the bicistronic SRSF7-PCE transcript. The first half acts as dominant-negative isoform suppressing poison cassette exon inclusion and instead promoting the retention of flanking introns containing repeated SRSF7 binding sites. Massive SRSF7 binding to these sites and its oligomerization promote the assembly of large nuclear bodies, which sequester SRSF7 transcripts at their transcription site, preventing their export and restoring normal SRSF7 protein levels. We further show that hundreds of human and mouse NMD targets, especially RNA-binding proteins, encode potential Split-ORFs, some of which are expressed under specific cellular conditions.},

Here we investigated whether including PEIs in computational models for the prediction of gene expression improves performance and interpretability.
RESULTS: We have extended our [Formula: see text] framework to include DNA contacts deduced from chromatin conformation capture experiments and compared various methods to determine PEIs using predictive modelling of gene expression from chromatin accessibility data and predicted transcription factor (TF) motif data. We designed a novel machine learning approach that allows the prioritization of TFs binding to distal loop and promoter regions with respect to their importance for gene expression regulation. Our analysis revealed a set of core TFs that are part of enhancer-promoter loops involving YY1 in different cell lines.
CONCLUSION: We present a novel approach that can be used to prioritize TFs involved in distal and promoter-proximal regulatory events by integrating chromatin accessibility, conformation, and gene expression data. We show that the integration of chromatin conformation data can improve gene expression prediction and aids model interpretability.},

	abstract = {The killer phenomenon in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) not only provides the opportunity to study host-virus interactions in a eukaryotic model but also represents a powerful tool to analyze potential coadaptional events and the role of killer yeast in biological diversity. Although undoubtedly having a crucial impact on the abundance and expression of the killer phenotype in killer-yeast harboring communities, the influence of a particular toxin on its producing host cell has not been addressed sufficiently. In this study, we describe a model system of two K1 killer yeast strains with distinct phenotypical differences pointing to substantial selection pressure in response to the toxin secretion level. Transcriptome and lipidome analyses revealed specific and intrinsic host cell adaptions dependent on the amount of K1 toxin produced. High basal expression of genes coding for osmoprotectants and stress-responsive proteins in a killer yeast strain secreting larger amounts of active K1 toxin implies a generally increased stress tolerance. Moreover, the data suggest that immunity of the host cell against its own toxin is essential for the balanced virus-host interplay providing valuable hints to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying K1 immunity and implicating an evolutionarily conserved role for toxin immunity in natural yeast populations.IMPORTANCE The killer phenotype in Saccharomyces cerevisiae relies on the cytoplasmic persistence of two RNA viruses. In contrast to bacterial toxin producers, killer yeasts necessitate a specific immunity mechanism against their own toxin because they bear the same receptor populations as sensitive cells. Although the killer phenomenon is highly abundant and has a crucial impact on the structure of yeast communities, the influence of a particular toxin on its host cell has been barely addressed. In our study, we used two derivatives secreting different amount of the killer toxin K1 to analyze potential coadaptional events in this particular host/virus system. Our data underline the dependency of the host cell's ability to cope with extracellular toxin molecules and intracellular K1 molecules provided by the virus. Therefore, this research significantly advances the current understanding of the evolutionarily conserved role of this molecular machinery as an intrinsic selection pressure in yeast populations.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btz855},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: A central aim of molecular biology is to identify mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Transcription factors (TFs), which are DNA-binding proteins, are highly involved in these processes, thus a crucial information is to know where TFs interact with DNA and to be aware of the TFs' DNA-binding motifs. For that reason, computational tools exist that link DNA-binding motifs to TFs either without sequence information or based on TF-associated sequences, e.g. identified via a chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiment.In this paper, we present MASSIF, a novel method to improve the performance of existing tools that link motifs to TFs relying on TF-associated sequences. MASSIF is based on the idea that a DNA-binding motif, which is correctly linked to a TF, should be assigned to a DNA-binding domain (DBD) similar to that of the mapped TF. Because DNA-binding motifs are in general not linked to DBDs, it is not possible to compare the DBD of a TF and the motif directly. Instead we created a DBD collection, which consist of TFs with a known DBD and an associated motif. This collection enables us to evaluate how likely it is that a linked motif and a TF of interest are associated to the same DBD. We named this similarity measure domain score, and represent it as a P-value. We developed two different ways to improve the performance of existing tools that link motifs to TFs based on TF-associated sequences: (i) using meta-analysis to combine P-values from one or several of these tools with the P-value of the domain score and (ii) filter unlikely motifs based on the domain score.
RESULTS: We demonstrate the functionality of MASSIF on several human ChIP-seq datasets, using either motifs from the HOCOMOCO database or de novo identified ones as input motifs. In addition, we show that both variants of our method improve the performance of tools that link motifs to TFs based on TF-associated sequences significantly independent of the considered DBD type.

	abstract = {Background: Understanding the location and cell-type specific binding of Transcription Factors (TFs) is important in the study of gene regulation. Computational prediction of TF binding sites is challenging, because TFs often bind only to short DNA motifs and cell-type specific co-factors may work together with the same TF to determine binding. Here, we consider the problem of learning a general model for the prediction of TF binding using DNase1-seq data and TF motif description in form of position specific energy matrices (PSEMs). Methods: We use TF ChIP-seq data as a gold-standard for model training and evaluation. Our contribution is a novel ensemble learning approach using random forest classifiers. In the context of the ENCODE-DREAM in vivo TF binding site prediction challenge we consider different learning setups. Results: Our results indicate that the ensemble learning approach is able to better generalize across tissues and cell-types compared to individual tissue-specific classifiers or a classifier built based upon data aggregated across tissues. Furthermore, we show that incorporating DNase1-seq peaks is essential to reduce the false positive rate of TF binding predictions compared to considering the raw DNase1 signal. Conclusions: Analysis of important features reveals that the models preferentially select motifs of other TFs that are close interaction partners in existing protein protein-interaction networks.

The mRNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP, gene name ZFP36) has been suggested as a tumor suppressor in several malignancies, but it increases insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of TTP in hepatocarcinogenesis and HCC progression. Employing liver-specific TTP-knockout (lsTtp-KO) mice in the diethylnitrosamine (DEN) hepatocarcinogenesis model, we observed a significantly reduced tumor burden compared to wild-type animals. Upon short-term DEN treatment, modelling early inflammatory processes in hepatocarcinogenesis, lsTtp-KO mice exhibited a reduced monocyte/macrophage ratio as compared to wild-type mice. While short-term DEN strongly induced an abundance of saturated and poly-unsaturated hepatic fatty acids, lsTtp-KO mice did not show these changes. These findings suggested anti-carcinogenic actions of TTP deletion due to effects on inflammation and metabolism. Interestingly, though, investigating effects of TTP on different hallmarks of cancer suggested tumor-suppressing actions: TTP inhibited proliferation, attenuated migration, and slightly increased chemosensitivity. In line with a tumor-suppressing activity, we observed a reduced expression of several oncogenes in TTP-overexpressing cells. Accordingly, ZFP36 expression was downregulated in tumor tissues in three large human data sets. Taken together, this study suggests that hepatocytic TTP promotes hepatocarcinogenesis, while it shows tumor-suppressive actions during hepatic tumor progression.},

However, we also find a high proportion of assay specific NDRs that are often 'called' by only one of the assays. We show evidence that these assay specific NDRs are indeed genuine open chromatin sites and contribute important information for accurate gene expression prediction. While technically ATAC-seq and DNase I-seq provide a superb high NDR calling rate for relatively low sequencing costs in comparison to NOMe-seq, NOMe-seq singles out for its genome-wide coverage allowing to not only detect NDRs but also endogenous DNA methylation and as we show here genome wide segmentation into heterochromatic B domains and local phasing of nucleosomes outside of NDRs.

Individual miRNAs may regulate hundreds of genes, giving rise to a complex gene regulatory network in which transcripts carrying miRNA binding sites act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Several methods for the analysis of ceRNA interactions exist, but these do often not adjust for statistical confounders or address the problem that more than one miRNA interacts with a target transcript.
RESULTS: We present SPONGE, a method for the fast construction of ceRNA networks. SPONGE uses 'multiple sensitivity correlation', a newly defined measure for which we can estimate a distribution under a null hypothesis. SPONGE can accurately quantify the contribution of multiple miRNAs to a ceRNA interaction with a probabilistic model that addresses previously neglected confounding factors and allows fast P-value calculation, thus outperforming existing approaches. We applied SPONGE to paired miRNA and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for studying global effects of miRNA-mediated cross-talk. Our results highlight already established and novel protein-coding and non-coding ceRNAs which could serve as biomarkers in cancer.

CAFs show a remarkable degree of heterogeneity, which is attributed to developmental origin or to local environmental niches, resulting in distinct CAF subsets within individual tumors. While CAF heterogeneity is frequently investigated in late-stage tumors, data on longitudinal CAF development in tumors are lacking. To this end, we used the transgenic polyoma middle T oncogene-induced mouse mammary carcinoma model and performed whole transcriptome analysis in FACS-sorted fibroblasts from early- and late-stage tumors. We observed a shift in fibroblast populations over time towards a subset previously shown to negatively correlate with patient survival, which was confirmed by multispectral immunofluorescence analysis. Moreover, we identified a transcriptomic signature distinguishing CAFs from early- and late-stage tumors. Importantly, the signature of early-stage CAFs correlated well with tumor stage and survival in human mammary carcinoma patients. A random forest analysis suggested predictive value of the complete set of differentially expressed genes between early- and late-stage CAFs on bulk tumor patient samples, supporting the clinical relevance of our findings. In conclusion, our data show transcriptome alterations in CAFs during tumorigenesis in the mammary gland, which suggest that CAFs are educated by the tumor over time to promote tumor development.

Integrative analysis of siRNA abundance and gene expression levels revealed surprisingly that mRNA and siRNA show negative as well as positive associations. Two RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase mutants, RDR1 and RDR2, show a drastic loss of siRNAs especially in phased SRCs accompanied with increased mRNA levels.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, not least due to its high chemoresistance. The long non-coding RNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), localised in nuclear paraspeckles, has been shown to enhance chemoresistance in several cancer types. Since data on NEAT1 in HCC chemosensitivity are completely lacking and chemoresistance is linked to poor prognosis, we aimed to study NEAT1 expression in HCC chemoresistance and its link to HCC prognosis.
METHODS: NEAT1 expression was determined in either sensitive, or sorafenib, or doxorubicin resistant HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, and Huh7 cells by qPCR. Paraspeckles were detected by immunostaining of paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1) in cell culture and in a cohort of HCC patients. PSPC1 expression was correlated with clinical data. The expression of transcript variants of NEAT1 and transcripts encoding the paraspeckle-associated proteins was analysed in the TCGA liver cancer data set.
RESULTS: NEAT1 was overexpressed in all three sorafenib and doxorubicin resistant cell lines. Paraspeckles were present in all chemoresistant cells, whereas no signal was detected in the sensitive cells. Expression of NEAT1 transcripts as well as transcripts encoding PSPC1, NONO, and RBM14 was increased in tumour tissue. Expression of PSPC1, NONO, and RBM14 transcripts was significantly associated with poor survival, whereas NEAT1 expression was not. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that nuclear and cytoplasmic PSPC1-positivity was significantly associated with shorter overall survival of HCC patients.
CONCLUSION: Our data show an induction of NEAT1 in HCC chemoresistance and a high correlation of transcripts encoding paraspeckle-associated proteins with poor survival in HCC. Therefore, NEAT1, PSPC1, NONO, and RBM14 might be promising targets for novel HCC therapies, and the paraspeckle-associated proteins might be clinical markers and predictors for poor survival in HCC.},

However, assembly of large sequencing datasets produced by modern technologies is challenging and computationally intensive. In-silico read normalization has been suggested as a computational strategy to reduce redundancy in read datasets, which leads to significant speedups and memory savings of assembly pipelines. Previously, we presented a set multi-cover optimization based approach, ORNA, where reads are reduced without losing important k-mer connectivity information, as used in assembly graphs. Here we propose extensions to ORNA, named ORNA-Q and ORNA-K, which consider a weighted set multi-cover optimization formulation for the in-silico read normalization problem. These novel formulations make use of the base quality scores obtained from sequencers (ORNA-Q) or k-mer abundances of reads (ORNA-K) to improve normalization further. We devise efficient heuristic algorithms for solving both formulations. In applications to human RNA-seq data, ORNA-Q and ORNA-K are shown to assemble more or equally many full length transcripts compared to other normalization methods at similar or higher read reduction values. The algorithm is implemented under the latest version of ORNA (v2.0, https://github.com/SchulzLab/ORNA ).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate nearly all biological pathways. Because the dysregulation of miRs can lead to disease progression, they are being explored as novel therapeutic targets. However, the cell type-specific effects of miRs in the heart are poorly understood. Thus, we assessed miR target regulation using miR-92a-3p as an example. Inhibition of miR-92a is known to improve endothelial cell function and recovery after acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS: miR-92a-3p was inhibited by locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based antimiR (LNA-92a) in mice after myocardial infarction. Expression of regulated genes was evaluated 3 days after myocardial infarction by RNA sequencing of isolated endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and CD45+ hematopoietic cells.
RESULTS: LNA-92a depleted miR-92a-3p expression in all cell types and derepressed predicted miR-92a-3p targets in a cell type-specific manner. RNAseq showed endothelial cell-specific regulation of autophagy-related genes. Imaging confirmed increased endothelial cell autophagy in LNA-92a treated relative to control animals. In vitro inhibition of miR-92a-3p augmented EC autophagy, derepressed autophagy-related gene 4a, and increased luciferase activity in autophagy-related gene 4a 3'UTR containing reporters, whereas miR-92a-3p overexpression had the opposite effect. In cardiomyocytes, LNA-92a derepressed metabolism-related genes, notably, the high-density lipoprotein transporter Abca8b. LNA-92a further increased fatty acid uptake and mitochondrial function in cardiomyocytes in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that miRs have cell type-specific effects in vivo. Analysis of miR targets in cell subsets disclosed a novel function of miR-92a-3p in endothelial cell autophagy and cardiomyocyte metabolism. Because autophagy is upregulated during ischemia to supply nutrients and cardiomyocyte metabolic-switching improves available substrate utilization, these prosurvival mechanisms may diminish tissue damage.},

We generated time-series transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles during differentiation of mouse multipotent bone marrow stromal cell line (ST2) toward adipocytes and osteoblasts. Using our novel approach we constructed time-resolved GRNs for both lineages and identifed the shared TFs involved in both differentiation processes. To take an alternative approach to prioritize the identified shared regulators, we mapped dynamic super-enhancers in both lineages and associated them to target genes with correlated expression profiles. The combination of the two approaches identified aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and Glis family zinc finger 1 (GLIS1) as mesenchymal key TFs controlled by dynamic cell type-specific super-enhancers that become repressed in both lineages. AHR and GLIS1 control differentiation-induced genes and their overexpression can inhibit the lineage commitment of the multipotent bone marrow-derived ST2 cells.},

However, utilizing all of these data effectively through integrative analysis is hampered by batch effects, large cell type heterogeneity and low replicate numbers. To study if batch effects across datasets can be observed and adjusted for, we analyze RNA-seq data of 215 samples from ENCODE, Roadmap, BLUEPRINT and DEEP as well as 1336 samples from GTEx and TCGA. While batch effects are a considerable issue, it is non-trivial to determine if batch adjustment leads to an improvement in data quality, especially in cases of low replicate numbers.
RESULTS: We present a novel method for assessing the performance of batch effect adjustment methods on heterogeneous data. Our method borrows information from the Cell Ontology to establish if batch adjustment leads to a better agreement between observed pairwise similarity and similarity of cell types inferred from the ontology. A comparison of state-of-the art batch effect adjustment methods suggests that batch effects in heterogeneous datasets with low replicate numbers cannot be adequately adjusted. Better methods need to be developed, which can be assessed objectively in the framework presented here.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bidirectional promoters (BPs) are prevalent in eukaryotic genomes. However, it is poorly understood how the cell integrates different epigenomic information, such as transcription factor (TF) binding and chromatin marks, to drive gene expression at BPs. Single-cell sequencing technologies are revolutionizing the field of genome biology. Therefore, this study focuses on the integration of single-cell RNA-seq data with bulk ChIP-seq and other epigenetics data, for which single-cell technologies are not yet established, in the context of BPs.
RESULTS: We performed integrative analyses of novel human single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data with bulk ChIP-seq and other epigenetics data. scRNA-seq data revealed distinct transcription states of BPs that were previously not recognized. We find associations between these transcription states to distinct patterns in structural gene features, DNA accessibility, histone modification, DNA methylation and TF binding profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a complex interplay of all of these elements is required to achieve BP-specific transcriptional output in this specialized promoter configuration. Further, our study implies that novel statistical methods can be developed to deconvolute masked subpopulations of cells measured with different bulk epigenomic assays using scRNA-seq data.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: De Bruijn graphs are a common assembly data structure for sequencing datasets. But with the advances in sequencing technologies, assembling high coverage datasets has become a computational challenge. Read normalization, which removes redundancy in datasets, is widely applied to reduce resource requirements. Current normalization algorithms, though efficient, provide no guarantee to preserve important k-mers that form connections between regions in the graph.
RESULTS: Here, normalization is phrased as a set multi-cover problem on reads and a heuristic algorithm, Optimized Read Normalization Algorithm (ORNA), is proposed. ORNA normalizes to the minimum number of reads required to retain all k-mers and their relative k-mer abundances from the original dataset. Hence, all connections from the original graph are preserved. ORNA was tested on various RNA-seq datasets with different coverage values. It was compared to the current normalization algorithms and was found to be performing better. Normalizing error corrected data allows for more accurate assemblies compared to the normalized uncorrected dataset. Further, an application is proposed in which multiple datasets are combined and normalized to predict novel transcripts that would have been missed otherwise. Finally, ORNA is a general purpose normalization algorithm that is fast and significantly reduces datasets with loss of assembly quality in between [1, 30]\% depending on reduction stringency.

Our data show up-regulation of several HCC marker genes and miRNAs (miR438-3p and miR151-5p). To characterize the impact of miRNAs to their targets, integrative analysis of transcriptome-and miRNAome-dynamics in combination with IMP2 target prediction was carried out. Our analyses show that targets of expressed miRNAs become accumulated in the case that these transcripts have positive IMP2 binding prediction. Therefore, our data indicates that overexpression of IMP2 alters the regulatory capacity of many miRNAs and we conclude that IMP2 competes with miRNAs for binding sites on thousands of transcripts.

Because of the puzzling data on endogenous paramutations, their impact contributing to adaptive evolution in a Lamarckian manner remains unknown. An increasing number of studies characterizes the underlying siRNA accumulation pathways using transgene experiments. Also in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia, we induce trans silencing on the chromatin level by injection of truncated transgenes. Here, we characterize the efficiency of this mechanism at different temperatures showing that silencing of the endogenous genes is temperature dependent. Analyzing different transgene constructs at different copy numbers, we dissected whether silencing efficiency is due to varying precursor RNAs or siRNA accumulation. Our data shows that silencing efficiency correlates with more efficient accumulation of primary siRNAs at higher temperatures rather than higher expression of precursor RNAs. Due to higher primary levels, secondary siRNAs also show temperature dependency and interestingly increase their relative proportion to primary siRNAs. Our data shows that efficient trans silencing on the chromatin level in P. tetraurelia depends on environmental parameters, thus being an important epigenetic factor limiting regulatory effects of siRNAs.},

Likely, this evolutionary success is connected to the altered phenotype arising from a symbiotic association. The potential variety of symbiont's contributions to new characteristics or abilities of host organisms are largely unstudied. Addressing this aspect, we focused on an obligate bacterial endosymbiont that confers an intraspecific killer phenotype to its host. The symbiosis between Paramecium tetraurelia and Caedibacter taeniospiralis, living in the host's cytoplasm, enables the infected paramecia to release Caedibacter symbionts, which can simultaneously produce a peculiar protein structure and a toxin. The ingestion of bacteria that harbor both components leads to the death of symbiont-free congeners. Thus, the symbiosis provides Caedibacter-infected cells a competitive advantage, the "killer trait." We characterized the adaptive gene expression patterns in symbiont-harboring Paramecium as a second symbiosis-derived aspect next to the killer phenotype. Comparative transcriptomics of infected P. tetraurelia and genetically identical symbiont-free cells confirmed altered gene expression in the symbiont-bearing line. Our results show up-regulation of specific metabolic and heat shock genes whereas down-regulated genes were involved in signaling pathways and cell cycle regulation. Functional analyses to validate the transcriptomics results demonstrated that the symbiont increases host density hence providing a fitness advantage. Comparative transcriptomics shows gene expression modulation of a ciliate caused by its bacterial endosymbiont thus revealing new adaptive advantages of the symbiosis. Caedibacter taeniospiralis apparently increases its host fitness via manipulation of metabolic pathways and cell cycle control.},

	abstract = {The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 represents a maternally expressed and epigenetically regulated imprinted gene product and is discussed to have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive actions. Recently, H19 was shown to be regulated under inflammatory conditions. Therefore, aim of this study was to determine the function of H19 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), an inflammation-associated type of tumor. In four different human HCC patient cohorts H19 was distinctly downregulated in tumor tissue compared to normal or non-tumorous adjacent tissue. We therefore determined the action of H19 in three different human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Plc/Prf5, and Huh7). Clonogenicity and proliferation assays showed that H19 overexpression could suppress tumor cell survival and proliferation after treatment with either sorafenib or doxorubicin, suggesting chemosensitizing actions of H19. Since HCC displays a highly chemoresistant tumor entity, cell lines resistant to doxorubicin or sorafenib were established. In all six chemoresistant cell lines H19 expression was significantly downregulated. The promoter methylation of the H19 gene was significantly different in chemoresistant cell lines compared to their sensitive counterparts. Chemoresistant cells were sensitized after H19 overexpression by either increasing the cytotoxic action of doxorubicin or decreasing cell proliferation upon sorafenib treatment. An H19 knockout mouse model (H19Δ3) showed increased tumor development and tumor cell proliferation after treatment with the carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN) independent of the reciprocally imprinted insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). In conclusion, H19 suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis, hepatoma cell growth, and HCC chemoresistance. Thus, mimicking H19 action might be a potential target to overcome chemoresistance in future HCC therapy.},

Here, we present RegulatorTrail, a web service that provides rich functionality for the identification and prioritization of key transcriptional regulators that have a strong impact on, e.g. pathological processes. RegulatorTrail offers eight methods that use regulator binding information in combination with transcriptomic or epigenomic data to infer the most influential regulators. Our web service not only provides an intuitive web interface, but also a well-documented RESTful API that allows for a straightforward integration into third-party workflows. The presented case studies highlight the capabilities of our web service and demonstrate its potential for the identification of influential regulators: we successfully identified regulators that might explain the increased malignancy in metastatic melanoma compared to primary tumors, as well as important regulators in macrophages.

	abstract = {The binding and contribution of transcription factors (TF) to cell specific gene expression is often deduced from open-chromatin measurements to avoid costly TF ChIP-seq assays. Thus, it is important to develop computational methods for accurate TF binding prediction in open-chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we report a novel segmentation-based method, TEPIC, to predict TF binding by combining sets of OCRs with position weight matrices. TEPIC can be applied to various open-chromatin data, e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq. Additionally, Histone-Marks (HMs) can be used to identify candidate TF binding sites. TEPIC computes TF affinities and uses open-chromatin/HM signal intensity as quantitative measures of TF binding strength. Using machine learning, we find low affinity binding sites to improve our ability to explain gene expression variability compared to the standard presence/absence classification of binding sites. Further, we show that both footprints and peaks capture essential TF binding events and lead to a good prediction performance. In our application, gene-based scores computed by TEPIC with one open-chromatin assay nearly reach the quality of several TF ChIP-seq data sets. Finally, these scores correctly predict known transcriptional regulators as illustrated by the application to novel DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq data for primary human hepatocytes and CD4+ T-cells, respectively.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btw217},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: De novo transcriptome assembly is an integral part for many RNA-seq workflows. Common applications include sequencing of non-model organisms, cancer or meta transcriptomes. Most de novo transcriptome assemblers use the de Bruijn graph (DBG) as the underlying data structure. The quality of the assemblies produced by such assemblers is highly influenced by the exact word length k As such no single kmer value leads to optimal results. Instead, DBGs over different kmer values are built and the assemblies are merged to improve sensitivity. However, no studies have investigated thoroughly the problem of automatically learning at which kmer value to stop the assembly. Instead a suboptimal selection of kmer values is often used in practice.
RESULTS: Here we investigate the contribution of a single kmer value in a multi-kmer based assembly approach. We find that a comparative clustering of related assemblies can be used to estimate the importance of an additional kmer assembly. Using a model fit based algorithm we predict the kmer value at which no further assemblies are necessary. Our approach is tested with different de novo assemblers for datasets with different coverage values and read lengths. Further, we suggest a simple post processing step that significantly improves the quality of multi-kmer assemblies.
CONCLUSION: We provide an automatic method for limiting the number of kmer values without a significant loss in assembly quality but with savings in assembly time. This is a step forward to making multi-kmer methods more reliable and easier to use.

	abstract = {Across kingdoms, RNA interference (RNAi) has been shown to control gene expression at the transcriptional- or the post-transcriptional level. Here, we describe a mechanism which involves both aspects: truncated transgenes, which fail to produce intact mRNA, induce siRNA accumulation and silencing of homologous loci in trans in the ciliate Paramecium We show that silencing is achieved by co-transcriptional silencing, associated with repressive histone marks at the endogenous gene. This is accompanied by secondary siRNA accumulation, strictly limited to the open reading frame of the remote locus. Our data shows that in this mechanism, heterochromatic marks depend on a variety of RNAi components. These include RDR3 and PTIWI14 as well as a second set of components, which are also involved in post-transcriptional silencing: RDR2, PTIWI13, DCR1 and CID2. Our data indicates differential processing of nascent un-spliced and long, spliced transcripts thus suggesting a hitherto-unrecognized functional interaction between post-transcriptional and co-transcriptional RNAi. Both sets of RNAi components are required for efficient trans-acting RNAi at the chromatin level and our data indicates similar mechanisms contributing to genome wide regulation of gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms.},

Regulation of such alterations depends on their time scale, where short-time adaptations differ from permanently established gene expression patterns maintained by epigenetic mechanisms. In the ciliate Paramecium, serotypes were described for an epigenetically controlled gene expression pattern of an individual multigene family. Paradoxically, individual serotypes can be triggered in Paramecium by alternating environments but are then stabilized by epigenetic mechanisms, thus raising the question to which extend their expression follows environmental stimuli. To characterize environmental adaptation in the context of epigenetically controlled serotype expression, we used RNA-seq to characterize transcriptomes of serotype pure cultures. The resulting vegetative transcriptome resource is first analysed for genes involved in the adaptive response to the altered environment. Secondly, we identified groups of genes that do not follow the adaptive response but show co-regulation with the epigenetically controlled serotype system, suggesting that their gene expression pattern becomes manifested by similar mechanisms. In our experimental set-up, serotype expression and the entire group of co-regulated genes were stable among environmental changes and only heat-shock genes altered expression of these gene groups. The data suggest that the maintenance of these gene expression patterns in a lineage represents epigenetically controlled robustness counteracting short-time adaptation processes.},

	abstract = {The ever-growing amount of data in the field of life sciences demands standardized ways of high-throughput computational analysis. This standardization requires a thorough documentation of each step in the computational analysis to enable researchers to understand and reproduce the results. However, due to the heterogeneity in software setups and the high rate of change during tool development, reproducibility is hard to achieve. One reason is that there is no common agreement in the research community on how to document computational studies. In many cases, simple flat files or other unstructured text documents are provided by researchers as documentation, which are often missing software dependencies, versions and sufficient documentation to understand the workflow and parameter settings. As a solution we suggest a simple and modest approach for documenting and verifying computational analysis pipelines. We propose a two-part scheme that defines a computational analysis using a Process and an Analysis metadata document, which jointly describe all necessary details to reproduce the results. In this design we separate the metadata specifying the process from the metadata describing an actual analysis run, thereby reducing the effort of manual documentation to an absolute minimum. Our approach is independent of a specific software environment, results in human readable XML documents that can easily be shared with other researchers and allows an automated validation to ensure consistency of the metadata. Because our approach has been designed with little to no assumptions concerning the workflow of an analysis, we expect it to be applicable in a wide range of computational research fields.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Automatic error correction of high-throughput sequencing data can have a dramatic impact on the amount of usable base pairs and their quality. It has been shown that the performance of tasks such as de novo genome assembly and SNP calling can be dramatically improved after read error correction. While a large number of methods specialized for correcting substitution errors as found in Illumina data exist, few methods for the correction of indel errors, common to technologies like 454 or Ion Torrent, have been proposed.
RESULTS: We present Fiona, a new stand-alone read error-correction method. Fiona provides a new statistical approach for sequencing error detection and optimal error correction and estimates its parameters automatically. Fiona is able to correct substitution, insertion and deletion errors and can be applied to any sequencing technology. It uses an efficient implementation of the partial suffix array to detect read overlaps with different seed lengths in parallel. We tested Fiona on several real datasets from a variety of organisms with different read lengths and compared its performance with state-of-the-art methods. Fiona shows a constantly higher correction accuracy over a broad range of datasets from 454 and Ion Torrent sequencers, without compromise in speed.
CONCLUSION: Fiona is an accurate parameter-free read error-correction method that can be run on inexpensive hardware and can make use of multicore parallelization whenever available. Fiona was implemented using the SeqAn library for sequence analysis and is publicly available for download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/fiona.

Current methods for identifying miRNA targets by combining sequence and miRNA and mRNA expression data do not adequately use the temporal information and thus miss important miRNAs and their targets. We developed the MIRna Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (mirDREM), a probabilistic modeling method that uses input-output hidden Markov models to reconstruct dynamic regulatory networks that explain how temporal gene expression is jointly regulated by miRNAs and transcription factors. We measured miRNA and mRNA expression for postnatal lung development in mice and used mirDREM to study the regulation of this process. The reconstructed dynamic network correctly identified known miRNAs and transcription factors. The method has also provided predictions about additional miRNAs regulating this process and the specific developmental phases they regulate, several of which were experimentally validated. Our analysis uncovered links between miRNAs involved in lung development and differentially expressed miRNAs in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients, some of which we have experimentally validated using proliferation assays.

	abstract = {Sequencing of RNAs (RNA-Seq) has revolutionized the field of transcriptomics, but the reads obtained often contain errors. Read error correction can have a large impact on our ability to accurately assemble transcripts. This is especially true for de novo transcriptome analysis, where a reference genome is not available. Current read error correction methods, developed for DNA sequence data, cannot handle the overlapping effects of non-uniform abundance, polymorphisms and alternative splicing. Here we present SEquencing Error CorrEction in Rna-seq data (SEECER), a hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based method, which is the first to successfully address these problems. SEECER efficiently learns hundreds of thousands of HMMs and uses these to correct sequencing errors. Using human RNA-Seq data, we show that SEECER greatly improves on previous methods in terms of quality of read alignment to the genome and assembly accuracy. To illustrate the usefulness of SEECER for de novo transcriptome studies, we generated new RNA-Seq data to study the development of the sea cucumber Parastichopus parvimensis. Our corrected assembled transcripts shed new light on two important stages in sea cucumber development. Comparison of the assembled transcripts to known transcripts in other species has also revealed novel transcripts that are unique to sea cucumber, some of which we have experimentally validated.

	doi = {10.1186/1752-0509-6-104},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modeling dynamic regulatory networks is a major challenge since much of the protein-DNA interaction data available is static. The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) uses a Hidden Markov Model-based approach to integrate this static interaction data with time series gene expression leading to models that can determine when transcription factors (TFs) activate genes and what genes they regulate. DREM has been used successfully in diverse areas of biological research. However, several issues were not addressed by the original version.
RESULTS: DREM 2.0 is a comprehensive software for reconstructing dynamic regulatory networks that supports interactive graphical or batch mode. With version 2.0 a set of new features that are unique in comparison with other softwares are introduced. First, we provide static interaction data for additional species. Second, DREM 2.0 now accepts continuous binding values and we added a new method to utilize TF expression levels when searching for dynamic models. Third, we added support for discriminative motif discovery, which is particularly powerful for species with limited experimental interaction data. Finally, we improved the visualization to support the new features. Combined, these changes improve the ability of DREM 2.0 to accurately recover dynamic regulatory networks and make it much easier to use it for analyzing such networks in several species with varying degrees of interaction information.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The identity of cells and tissues is to a large degree governed by transcriptional regulation. A major part is accomplished by the combinatorial binding of transcription factors at regulatory sequences, such as enhancers. Even though binding of transcription factors is sequence-specific, estimating the sequence similarity of two functionally similar enhancers is very difficult. However, a similarity measure for regulatory sequences is crucial to detect and understand functional similarities between two enhancers and will facilitate large-scale analyses like clustering, prediction and classification of genome-wide datasets.
RESULTS: We present the standardized alignment-free sequence similarity measure N2, a flexible framework that is defined for word neighbourhoods. We explore the usefulness of adding reverse complement words as well as words including mismatches into the neighbourhood. On simulated enhancer sequences as well as functional enhancers in mouse development, N2 is shown to outperform previous alignment-free measures. N2 is flexible, faster than competing methods and less susceptible to single sequence noise and the occurrence of repetitive sequences. Experiments on the mouse enhancers reveal that enhancers active in different tissues can be separated by pairwise comparison using N2.
CONCLUSION: N2 represents an improvement over previous alignment-free similarity measures without compromising speed, which makes it a good candidate for large-scale sequence comparison of regulatory sequences.

Sequencing reads crossing boundaries of structural variation carry the potential for their identification, but are difficult to map.
RESULTS: Here we present a method for 'split' read mapping, where prefix and suffix match of a read may be interrupted by a longer gap in the read-to-reference alignment. We use this method to accurately detect medium-sized insertions and long deletions with precise breakpoints in genomic resequencing data. Compared with alternative split mapping methods, SplazerS significantly improves sensitivity for detecting large indel events, especially in variant-rich regions. Our method is robust in the presence of sequencing errors as well as alignment errors due to genomic mutations/divergence, and can be used on reads of variable lengths. Our analysis shows that SplazerS is a versatile tool applicable to unanchored or single-end as well as anchored paired-end reads. In addition, application of SplazerS to targeted resequencing data led to the interesting discovery of a complete, possibly functional gene retrocopy variant.

By studying promoter sequences of the human ribosomal protein genes we recently identified a novel highly specific Localized Tandem Sequence Motif (LTSM). In this work we sought to identify additional genes and LTSM-binding proteins to elucidate potential regulatory mechanisms.
RESULTS: Genome-wide analyses allowed finding a considerable number of additional LTSM-positive genes, the products of which are involved in translation, among them, translation initiation and elongation factors, and 5S rRNA. Electromobility shift assays then showed specific signals demonstrating the binding of protein complexes to LTSM in ribosomal protein gene promoters. Pull-down assays with LTSM-containing oligonucleotides and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis identified the related multifunctional nucleotide binding proteins NonO and SFPQ in the binding complex. Functional characterization then revealed that LTSM enhances the transcriptional activity of the promoters in dependency of the distance from the transcription start site.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the power of bioinformatic analyses for the identification of biologically relevant sequence motifs. LTSM and the here found LTSM-binding proteins NonO and SFPQ were discovered through a synergistic combination of bioinformatic and biochemical methods and are regulators of the expression of a set of genes of the translational apparatus in a distance-dependent manner.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Semantic similarity searches in ontologies are an important component of many bioinformatic algorithms, e.g., finding functionally related proteins with the Gene Ontology or phenotypically similar diseases with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We have recently shown that the performance of semantic similarity searches can be improved by ranking results according to the probability of obtaining a given score at random rather than by the scores themselves. However, to date, there are no algorithms for computing the exact distribution of semantic similarity scores, which is necessary for computing the exact P-value of a given score.
RESULTS: In this paper we consider the exact computation of score distributions for similarity searches in ontologies, and introduce a simple null hypothesis which can be used to compute a P-value for the statistical significance of similarity scores. We concentrate on measures based on Resnik's definition of ontological similarity. A new algorithm is proposed that collapses subgraphs of the ontology graph and thereby allows fast score distribution computation. The new algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than the naive approach, as we demonstrate by computing score distributions for similarity searches in the HPO. It is shown that exact P-value calculation improves clinical diagnosis using the HPO compared to approaches based on sampling.
CONCLUSIONS: The new algorithm enables for the first time exact P-value calculation via exact score distribution computation for ontology similarity searches. The approach is applicable to any ontology for which the annotation-propagation rule holds and can improve any bioinformatic method that makes only use of the raw similarity scores. The algorithm was implemented in Java, supports any ontology in OBO format, and is available for non-commercial and academic usage under: https://compbio.charite.de/svn/hpo/trunk/src/tools/significance/},

Many motif discovery methods do not scale well to large datasets. Another issue is identifying discriminative rather than generative motifs. Such discriminative motifs are important for identifying co-factors and for explaining changes in behavior between different conditions.
RESULTS: To address these issues we developed a method for DECOnvolved Discriminative motif discovery (DECOD). DECOD uses a k-mer count table and so its running time is independent of the size of the input set. By deconvolving the k-mers DECOD considers context information without using the sequences directly. DECOD outperforms previous methods both in speed and in accuracy when using simulated and real biological benchmark data. We performed new binding experiments for p53 mutants and used DECOD to identify p53 co-factors, suggesting new mechanisms for p53 activation.

Here, we show that functional similarities between enhancer binding proteins and their transcriptional targets and proximity in the protein-protein interactome improve prediction of target genes. We used all four features to train random forest classifiers that predict target genes with a recall of 58\% in 2 Mb intervals that may contain dozens of genes, representing a better than two-fold improvement over the performance of prediction based on single features alone. Genome-wide ChIP data is still relatively poorly understood, and it remains difficult to assign biological significance to binding events.

	abstract = {Alternative splicing, polyadenylation of pre-messenger RNA molecules and differential promoter usage can produce a variety of transcript isoforms whose respective expression levels are regulated in time and space, thus contributing specific biological functions. However, the repertoire of mammalian alternative transcripts and their regulation are still poorly understood. Second-generation sequencing is now opening unprecedented routes to address the analysis of entire transcriptomes. Here, we developed methods that allow the prediction and quantification of alternative isoforms derived solely from exon expression levels in RNA-Seq data. These are based on an explicit statistical model and enable the prediction of alternative isoforms within or between conditions using any known gene annotation, as well as the relative quantification of known transcript structures. Applying these methods to a human RNA-Seq dataset, we validated a significant fraction of the predictions by RT-PCR. Data further showed that these predictions correlated well with information originating from junction reads. A direct comparison with exon arrays indicated improved performances of RNA-Seq over microarrays in the prediction of skipped exons. Altogether, the set of methods presented here comprehensively addresses multiple aspects of alternative isoform analysis. The software is available as an open-source R-package called Solas at http://cmb.molgen.mpg.de/2ndGenerationSequencing/Solas/.},

This process can be complicated by the fact that the features can have varying degrees of specificity, as well as by the presence of features unrelated to the disease itself. Depending on the experience of the physician and the availability of laboratory tests, clinical abnormalities may be described in greater or lesser detail. We have adapted semantic similarity metrics to measure phenotypic similarity between queries and hereditary diseases annotated with the use of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and have developed a statistical model to assign p values to the resulting similarity scores, which can be used to rank the candidate diseases. We show that our approach outperforms simpler term-matching approaches that do not take the semantic interrelationships between terms into account. The advantage of our approach was greater for queries containing phenotypic noise or imprecise clinical descriptions. The semantic network defined by the HPO can be used to refine the differential diagnosis by suggesting clinical features that, if present, best differentiate among the candidate diagnoses. Thus, semantic similarity searches in ontologies represent a useful way of harnessing the semantic structure of human phenotypic abnormalities to help with the differential diagnosis.

	abstract = {Ultraconservation has been variously defined to describe sequences that have remained identical or nearly so over long periods of evolution to a degree that is higher than expected for sequences under typical constraints associated with protein-coding sequences, splice sites, or transcription factor binding sites. Most intergenic ultraconserved elements (UCE) appear to be tissue-specific enhancers, whereas another class of intragenic UCEs is involved in regulation of gene expression by means of alternative splicing. In this study we define a set of 2827 short ultraconserved promoter regions (SUPR) in 5 kb upstream regions of 1268 human protein-coding genes using a definition of 98\% identity for at least 30 bp in 7 mammalian species. Our analysis shows that SUPRs are enriched in genes playing a role in regulation and development. Many of the genes having a SUPR-containing promoter have additional alternative promoters that do not contain SUPRs. Comparison of such promoters by CAGE tag, EST, and Solexa read analysis revealed that SUPR-associated transcripts show a significantly higher mean expression than transcripts associated with non-SUPR-containing promoters. The same was true for the comparison between all SUPR-associated and non-SUPR-associated transcripts on a genome-wide basis. SUPR-associated genes show a highly significant tendency to occur in regions that are also enriched for intergenic short ultraconserved elements (SUE) in the vicinity of developmental genes. A number of predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are overrepresented in SUPRs and SUEs, including those for transcription factors of the homeodomain family, but in contrast to SUEs, SUPRs are also enriched in core-promoter motifs. These observations suggest that SUPRs delineate a distinct class of ultraconserved sequences.},

However, mapping chromosome breakpoints using traditional methods, such as in situ hybridization with fluorescent dye-labeled bacterial artificial chromosome clones (BAC-FISH), is rather laborious and time-consuming. In addition, the resolution of BAC-FISH is often insufficient to unequivocally identify the disrupted gene. To overcome these limitations, we have performed shotgun sequencing of flow-sorted derivative chromosomes using "next-generation" (Illumina/Solexa) multiplex sequencing-by-synthesis technology. As shown here for three different disease-associated BCRs, the coverage attained by this platform is sufficient to bridge the breakpoints by PCR amplification, and this procedure allows the determination of their exact nucleotide positions within a few weeks. Its implementation will greatly facilitate large-scale breakpoint mapping and gene finding in patients with disease-associated balanced translocations.},

Human FBN1 has three untranslated upstream exons, and homologous sequences can be identified in a number of mammalian species. In this work, we have used functional assays to characterize the FBN1 upstream region. Sequences upstream of exon 1 and at least two of the upstream untranslated exons were shown to possess promoter activity in vitro. The strongest activity in luciferase assays was shown for sequences upstream of the untranslated exon A. Sequence analysis of the sequences in and upstream of exon A in humans and six other mammalian species demonstrated several highly conserved potential cis-acting sequences as well as a 66-basepair (bp) ultraconserved sequence with nearly perfect conservation in the seven species. The ultraconserved sequence contains an initiator element (Inr), a downstream promoter element (DPE), and a 10-bp palindromic element. Mutational assays showed that both the Inr and the DPE are critical for full promoter activity. A mutation of the 10-bp palindromic element completely abolished basal promoter activity. The element was shown to bind specifically to an unknown nuclear protein by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Ultraconservation within an alternate promoter has not been previously reported. We suggest that the ultraconservation may reflect the importance of finely tuned regulation of alternate transcription of FBN1 and that the sequences involved have been under negative selective pressure for at least the last 180 million years of mammalian evolution.},

            Identifying regulatory regions in the genome is of great interest for understanding the epigenomic landscape in cells. One fundamental challenge in this context is to find the target genes whose expression is affected by the regulatory regions. A recent successful method is the Activity-By-Contact (ABC) model (Fulco et al., 2019) which scores enhancer-gene interactions based on enhancer activity and the contact frequency of an enhancer to its target gene. However, it describes regulatory interactions entirely from a gene’s perspective, and does not account for all the candidate target genes of an enhancer. In addition, the ABC-model requires two types of assays to measure enhancer activity, which limits the applicability. Moreover, there is no implementation available that could allow for an integration with transcription factor (TF) binding information nor an efficient analysis of single-cell data. We demonstrate that the ABC-score can yield a higher accuracy by adapting the enhancer activity according to the number of contacts the enhancer has to its candidate target genes and also by considering all annotated transcription start sites of a gene. Further, we show that the model is comparably accurate with only one assay to measure enhancer activity. We combined our generalised ABC-model (gABC) with TF binding information and illustrate an analysis of a single-cell ATAC-seq data set of the human heart, where we were able to characterise cell type-specific regulatory interactions and predict gene expression based on transcription factor affinities.

            Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are generated by back-splicing and control cellular signaling and phenotypes. Pericytes stabilize the capillary structure and play an important role in the formation and maintenance of new blood vessels. Here, we characterized hypoxia-regulated circRNAs in human pericytes and showed that circPLOD2 is induced by hypoxia and regulates pericyte function. Silencing of circPLOD2 increased pericyte proliferation, endothelial-pericyte interaction and tube formation. Transcriptional profiling of circPLOD2-depleted cells and epigenomic analyses revealed widespread changes in gene expression and identified the circPLOD2-dependent regulation of the transcription factor KLF4 as a key effector of these changes. Importantly, overexpression of
            KLF4
            was sufficient to reverse the effects on pericyte proliferation and endothelial-pericyte interactions observed after circPLOD2 depletion. Together, these data revealed a novel function of circPLOD2 in the control of pericyte proliferation and capillary formation and showed that circPLOD2-mediated regulation of KLF4 significantly contributes to the transcriptional response to hypoxia.

            Background
            Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled by cis-regulatory elements (CREs) including promoters and enhancers which are bound by transcription factors (TFs). Differential expression of TFs and their putative binding sites on CREs cause tissue and developmental-specific transcriptional activity. Consolidating genomic data sets can offer further insights into the accessibility of CREs, TF activity, and thus gene regulation. However, the integration and analysis of multi-modal data sets are hampered by considerable technical challenges. While methods for highlighting differential TF activity from combined ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data exist, they do not offer good usability, have limited support for large-scale data processing, and provide only minimal functionality for visual result interpretation.
          
          
            Results
            
              We developed TF-Prioritizer, an automated java pipeline to prioritize condition-specific TFs derived from multi-modal data. TF-Prioritizer creates an interactive, feature-rich, and user-friendly web report of its results. To showcase the potential of TF-Prioritizer, we identified known active TFs (e.g.,
              Stat5, Elf5, Nfib, Esr1
              ), their target genes (e.g., milk proteins and cell-cycle genes), and newly classified lactating mammary gland TFs (e.g.,
              Creb1, Arnt
              ).
            
          
          
            Conclusion
            TF-Prioritizer accepts ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, as input and suggests TFs with differential activity, thus offering an understanding of genome-wide gene regulation, potential pathogenesis, and therapeutic targets in biomedical research.},

            , a toolbox for TF motif analysis that combines information about DNA methylation with models capturing intra-motif dependencies. In a large-scale study using ChIP-seq data for 335 TFs, we identify novel TFs that are affected by DNA methylation. Overall, we find that CpG methylation decreases the likelihood of binding for the majority of TFs. For a considerable subset of TFs, we show that intra-motif dependencies are pivotal for accurately modelling the impact of DNA methylation on TF binding.},
