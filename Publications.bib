abstract = {Motivation: De novo transcriptome assembly is an integral part for many RNA-seq workflows. Common applications include sequencing of non-model organisms, cancer or meta transcriptomes. Most de novo transcriptome assemblers use the de Bruijn graph (DBG) as the underlying data structure. The quality of the assemblies produced by such assemblers is highly influenced by the exact word length k. As such no single kmer value leads to optimal results. Instead, DBGs over different kmer values are built and the assemblies are merged to improve sensitivity. However, no studies have investigated thoroughly the problem of automatically learning at which kmer value to stop the assembly. Instead a suboptimal selection of kmer values is often used in practice. Results: Here we investigate the contribution of a single kmer value in a multi-kmer based assembly approach. We find that a comparative clustering of related assemblies can be used to estimate the importance of an additional kmer assembly. Using a model fit based algorithm we predict the kmer value at which no further assemblies are necessary. Our approach is tested with different de novo assemblers for datasets with different coverage values and read lengths. Further, we suggest a simple post processing step that significantly improves the quality of multi-kmer assemblies. Conclusion: We provide an automatic method for limiting the number of kmer values without a significant loss in assembly quality but with savings in assembly time. This is a step forward to making multi-kmer methods more reliable and easier to use. Availability: A general implementation of our approach can be found under: https://github.com/SchulzLab/KREATION.

Methods for the analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data start by aligning the short reads to a reference genome. While often successful, they are not appropriate for cases where a reference genome is not available. Here we develop methods for de novo analysis of ChIP-seq data. Our methods combine de novo assembly with statistical tests enabling motif discovery without the use of a reference genome. We validate the performance of our method using human and mouse data. Analysis of fly data indicates that our method outperforms alignment based methods that utilize closely related species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modeling dynamic regulatory networks is a major challenge since much of the protein-DNA interaction data available is static. The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) uses a Hidden Markov Model-based approach to integrate this static interaction data with time series gene expression leading to models that can determine when transcription factors (TFs) activate genes and what genes they regulate. DREM has been used successfully in diverse areas of biological research. However, several issues were not addressed by the original version.

RESULTS: DREM 2.0 is a comprehensive software for reconstructing dynamic regulatory networks that supports interactive graphical or batch mode. With version 2.0 a set of new features that are unique in comparison with other softwares are introduced. First, we provide static interaction data for additional species. Second, DREM 2.0 now accepts continuous binding values and we added a new method to utilize TF expression levels when searching for dynamic models. Third, we added support for discriminative motif discovery, which is particularly powerful for species with limited experimental interaction data. Finally, we improved the visualization to support the new features. Combined, these changes improve the ability of DREM 2.0 to accurately recover dynamic regulatory networks and make it much easier to use it for analyzing such networks in several species with varying degrees of interaction information.

CONCLUSIONS: DREM 2.0 provides a unique framework for constructing and visualizing dynamic regulatory networks. DREM 2.0 can be downloaded from: http://www.sb.cs.cmu.edu/drem.},

abstract = {The regulation of gene expression in cells, including by microRNAs (miRNAs), is a dynamic process. Current methods for identifying miRNA targets by combining sequence and miRNA and mRNA expression data do not adequately use the temporal information and thus miss important miRNAs and their targets. We developed the MIRna Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (mirDREM), a probabilistic modeling method that uses input-output hidden Markov models to reconstruct dynamic regulatory networks that explain how temporal gene expression is jointly regulated by miRNAs and transcription factors. We measured miRNA and mRNA expression for postnatal lung development in mice and used mirDREM to study the regulation of this process. The reconstructed dynamic network correctly identified known miRNAs and transcription factors. The method has also provided predictions about additional miRNAs regulating this process and the specific developmental phases they regulate, several of which were experimentally validated. Our analysis uncovered links between miRNAs involved in lung development and differentially expressed miRNAs in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients, some of which we have experimentally validated using proliferation assays. These results indicate that some disease progression pathways in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may represent partial reversal of lung differentiation.},

We found that 66{\%} of the polyadenylated transcriptome mapped to known genes and 34{\%} to nonannotated genomic regions. On the basis of known transcripts, RNA-Seq can detect 25{\%} more genes than can microarrays. A global survey of messenger RNA splicing events identified 94,241 splice junctions (4096 of which were previously unidentified) and showed that exon skipping is the most prevalent form of alternative splicing.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing has made the analysis of new model organisms more affordable. Although assembling a new genome can still be costly and difficult, it is possible to use RNA-seq to sequence mRNA. In the absence of a known genome, it is necessary to assemble these sequences de novo, taking into account possible alternative isoforms and the dynamic range of expression values.

RESULTS: We present a software package named Oases designed to heuristically assemble RNA-seq reads in the absence of a reference genome, across a broad spectrum of expression values and in presence of alternative isoforms. It achieves this by using an array of hash lengths, a dynamic filtering of noise, a robust resolution of alternative splicing events and the efficient merging of multiple assemblies. It was tested on human and mouse RNA-seq data and is shown to improve significantly on the transABySS and Trinity de novo transcriptome assemblers.

abstract = {We evaluated 25 protocol variants of 14 independent computational methods for exon identification, transcript reconstruction and expression-level quantification from RNA-seq data. Our results show that most algorithms are able to identify discrete transcript components with high success rates but that assembly of complete isoform structures poses a major challenge even when all constituent elements are identified. Expression-level estimates also varied widely across methods, even when based on similar transcript models. Consequently, the complexity of higher eukaryotic genomes imposes severe limitations on transcript recall and splice product discrimination that are likely to remain limiting factors for the analysis of current-generation RNA-seq data.},

@article{Le2013b,
abstract = {Sequencing of RNAs (RNA-Seq) has revolutionized the field of transcriptomics, but the reads obtained often contain errors. Read error correction can have a large impact on our ability to accurately assemble transcripts. This is especially true for de novo transcriptome analysis, where a reference genome is not available. Current read error correction methods, developed for DNA sequence data, cannot handle the overlapping effects of non-uniform abundance, polymorphisms and alternative splicing. Here we present SEquencing Error CorrEction in Rna-seq data (SEECER), a hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based method, which is the first to successfully address these problems. SEECER efficiently learns hundreds of thousands of HMMs and uses these to correct sequencing errors. Using human RNA-Seq data, we show that SEECER greatly improves on previous methods in terms of quality of read alignment to the genome and assembly accuracy. To illustrate the usefulness of SEECER for de novo transcriptome studies, we generated new RNA-Seq data to study the development of the sea cucumber Parastichopus parvimensis. Our corrected assembled transcripts shed new light on two important stages in sea cucumber development. Comparison of the assembled transcripts to known transcripts in other species has also revealed novel transcripts that are unique to sea cucumber, some of which we have experimentally validated.

@article{Schulz2014b,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Automatic error correction of high-throughput sequencing data can have a dramatic impact on the amount of usable base pairs and their quality. It has been shown that the performance of tasks such as de novo genome assembly and SNP calling can be dramatically improved after read error correction. While a large number of methods specialized for correcting substitution errors as found in Illumina data exist, few methods for the correction of indel errors, common to technologies like 454 or Ion Torrent, have been proposed.

RESULTS: We present Fiona, a new stand-alone read error-correction method. Fiona provides a new statistical approach for sequencing error detection and optimal error correction and estimates its parameters automatically. Fiona is able to correct substitution, insertion and deletion errors and can be applied to any sequencing technology. It uses an efficient implementation of the partial suffix array to detect read overlaps with different seed lengths in parallel. We tested Fiona on several real datasets from a variety of organisms with different read lengths and compared its performance with state-of-the-art methods. Fiona shows a constantly higher correction accuracy over a broad range of datasets from 454 and Ion Torrent sequencers, without compromise in speed.

CONCLUSION: Fiona is an accurate parameter-free read error-correction method that can be run on inexpensive hardware and can make use of multicore parallelization whenever available. Fiona was implemented using the SeqAn library for sequence analysis and is publicly available for download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/fiona.
